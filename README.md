# Pigeon-Corp

​Mobile Idle Clicker game developed in 3 months​ as a **final Degree project**. It takes the game _Egg, Inc._ as the principal reference.

The objective is to build your pigeon farm and improve its production in order to increase your benefits. You can use your money to buy new hatcheries and new vehicles, to research and discover bonuses, and to buy pigeons.

Better hatcheries allow you to store more pigeons, while better vehicles allow you to increase the capacity of pigeon eggs that you can ship to sell. The bonuses will affect different parts of your farm, since they can be discounts, multipliers or increments.

Besides, you have different pigeon evolutions which you can unlock once you reach a certain farm value. Every time you decide to unlock a new evolution, the farm will be restarted but you will have this new pigeon with greater value, so that you will progress faster each time.
